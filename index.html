        <h1>What is Economics?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> The central concept in economics, which arises because resources are limited while human wants are unlimited.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Resources:</strong> The finite availability of resources such as land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlimited Wants:</strong> The endless desires and needs of individuals and societies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Factors of Production:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Resources such as machinery, buildings, and tools used in the production of goods and services. The return on capital is interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Labour:</strong> Human effort used in the production process. The return on labor is income.</li>
            <li><strong>Land:</strong> Natural resources used in production. The return on land is rent.</li>
            <li><strong>Entrepreneurship:</strong> The ability to combine the other factors of production to produce goods and services. The return on entrepreneurship is profit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Choices and Opportunity Cost:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choices:</strong> Due to scarcity, individuals and societies must make choices about how to allocate their limited resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity Cost:</strong> The cost of the next best alternative foregone when a choice is made.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Economic Questions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What to produce?</li>
            <li>How to produce?</li>
            <li>For whom to produce?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Economic Agents:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HH:</strong> Households</li>
            <li><strong>F:</strong> Firms</li>
            <li><strong>G:</strong> Government</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How Do Economists Approach the World?</h1>
        <h2>Models:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Economists use models to simplify and understand complex economic processes. One of the fundamental models is the Production Possibility Curve (PPC).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Production Possibility Curve (PPC):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PPC Definition:</strong> A graphical representation showing the maximum combination of goods and services that can be produced with available resources and technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Points on the PPC:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inside the PPC: Points represent inefficient use of resources, where not all resources are fully utilized.</li>
                    <li>On the PPC: Points represent efficient production levels, where resources are fully utilized.</li>
                    <li>Outside the PPC: Points represent unattainable production levels with current resources and technology, indicating scarcity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts Illustrated by the PPC:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scarcity:</strong> Limited resources mean not all wants can be satisfied.</li>
                    <li><strong>Opportunity Cost (OC):</strong> The cost of forgoing the next best alternative when making a choice. Illustrated by the movement along the PPC.</li>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Productive Efficiency:</strong> Producing goods and services at the lowest possible cost. Represented by any point on the PPC.</li>
                            <li><strong>Allocative Efficiency:</strong> Producing the combination of goods and services most desired by society.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Unemployment of Resources:</strong> Represented by points inside the PPC, indicating that not all resources are being used.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> Societies must choose which combination of goods and services to produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Actual Economic Growth:</strong> Represented by an outward shift of the PPC (from PPC1 to PPC2), indicating an increase in the capacity to produce.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Growth in PPC:</strong> An outward shift in the PPC indicates economic growth, which can result from factors such as an increase in resources, technological advancements, or improvements in the quality of labor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Macro & Micro Economics</h1>
        <h2>Macro and Micro:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Macro:</strong> The study of the economy as a whole.</li>
            <li><strong>Micro:</strong> The study of individual units within the economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Market</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods and services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Demand</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given period.</li>
            <li><strong>Law of Demand:</strong> The law of demand states that, ceteris paribus (all else being equal), as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is due to the substitution effect and the income effect. (P↑ Qd↓).</li>
            <li><strong>Determinants of Demand:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Price:</strong> The primary factor affecting demand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Price Determinants:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Income:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Normal Goods:</strong> Demand increases as income increases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Inferior Goods:</strong> Demand decreases as income increases.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Substitutes:</strong> Goods that can replace each other. An increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complements:</strong> Goods that are used together. An increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices during a given period.</li>
            <li><strong>Law of Supply:</strong> The law of supply states that, ceteris paribus, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa. This direct relationship is because higher prices provide an incentive for producers to supply more of the good (P↑ Qs↑).</li>
            <li><strong>Determinants of Supply:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Price:</strong> The primary factor affecting supply.</li>

                <h1>Situations to Draw Different Economic Graphs</h1>
        
                <h2>1. Production Possibility Curve (PPC)</h2>
                <h3>When to Draw a PPC:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Illustrating Scarcity and Trade-offs:</strong> Use a PPC to show the trade-offs between two goods or services that an economy can produce given its resources and technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demonstrating Opportunity Cost:</strong> Use a PPC to illustrate the opportunity cost of choosing one good over another.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Use a PPC to show economic growth by shifting the curve outward, indicating an increase in an economy's capacity to produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Employment vs. Recession:</strong> Use a PPC to show points of full employment (on the curve) and recession (inside the curve).</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A country produces only two goods: consumer goods and capital goods. Draw a PPC to show the maximum possible production combinations of these two goods.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>PPC</strong></p>
        
                <h2>2. Demand Curve</h2>
                <h3>When to Draw a Demand Curve:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analyzing Consumer Behavior:</strong> Use a demand curve to show how the quantity demanded of a good changes with its price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Price Changes:</strong> Use a demand curve to illustrate the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded (Law of Demand).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shifts in Demand:</strong> Use a demand curve to show how factors other than price (e.g., income, tastes, prices of related goods) shift the demand curve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw a demand curve for coffee to show how the quantity demanded changes as the price changes.</li>
                </ul>
                
        
                <h2>3. Supply Curve</h2>
                <h3>When to Draw a Supply Curve:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Analyzing Producer Behavior:</strong> Use a supply curve to show how the quantity supplied of a good changes with its price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impact of Price Changes:</strong> Use a supply curve to illustrate the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied (Law of Supply).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shifts in Supply:</strong> Use a supply curve to show how factors other than price (e.g., production costs, technology, government policies) shift the supply curve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw a supply curve for coffee to show how the quantity supplied changes as the price changes.</li>
                </ul>
               
        
                <h2>4. Combined Demand and Supply Graph</h2>
                <h3>When to Draw Both Demand and Supply Curves:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Determining Market Equilibrium:</strong> Use both demand and supply curves to find the equilibrium price and quantity where the two curves intersect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analyzing Market Changes:</strong> Use both curves to analyze how shifts in demand and/or supply affect the equilibrium price and quantity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding Surpluses and Shortages:</strong> Use both curves to illustrate conditions of excess supply (surplus) and excess demand (shortage) and how prices adjust to restore equilibrium.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Draw both demand and supply curves for coffee to determine the equilibrium price and quantity. Show how an increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right, leading to a new equilibrium.</li>
                </ul>
